The `pages` directory in a Next.js application is a crucial part of its file-based routing system. Each file or folder inside the `pages` directory corresponds to a route within the application. By default, Next.js automatically generates routes based on the file and folder structure within the `pages` directory. Components within these files are treated as top-level components that represent individual pages of the application. These components are responsible for rendering content, managing state, and handling logic specific to their respective pages.

This directory contains the main components that represent individual pages of the application. Each file or folder in the directory corresponds to a route within the application. These components are responsible for rendering and managing the logic for each page. They may import and utilize other components from various locations within the application to build the complete UI for each page. The `index.tsx` pages are the root pages for each directory and subdirectory.  

# **Pages**
## **`/`**
### **`_app.tsx`**
Defines the root _app.tsx component of a Next.js application, integrating Recoil for state management and Chakra UI for styling.

**Description**

The `_app.tsx` file is a custom App component in a Next.js application, which is used to initialize pages and wrap around all components in the application. In this specific implementation, the application is utilizing Recoil for global state management and Chakra UI for component styling and theming.

The custom App component takes in the `Component` and `pageProps` properties from the `AppProps` type provided by Next.js. It returns a JSX structure containing the `RecoilRoot`, `ChakraProvider`, and a custom `Layout` component. The `RecoilRoot` component wraps around the entire application, allowing components to access and manage global state using Recoil. The `ChakraProvider` component wraps around the application, providing Chakra UI styling and theming. The custom `Layout` component is used for consistent page layout throughout the application. Lastly, the `Component` prop represents the page components with their respective `pageProps` spread onto them.

**Purpose**

The purpose of this code is to set up the root component of a Next.js application, integrating Recoil for global state management and Chakra UI for component styling and theming. It also provides a consistent layout for all pages of the application through the `Layout` component.

### **`_document.tsx`**
Defines a custom `_document.tsx` component in a Next.js application, which is used to augment the application's HTML structure and includes essential elements such as language, head, and body.

**Description**

The `_document.tsx` file is a custom Document component in a Next.js application, which allows you to modify the server-rendered HTML structure. In this specific implementation, the Document component is a simple function component that returns a JSX structure.

The JSX structure consists of an `Html` component with the `lang` attribute set to "en" (English). The `Head` component is a Next.js provided component for managing the HTML head section. The `body` element contains two Next.js provided components, `Main` and `NextScript`. The `Main` component is responsible for rendering the application's content, while the `NextScript` component is used to include Next.js scripts required for the application to function properly.

**Purpose**

The purpose of this code is to set up a custom Document component in a Next.js application, allowing for modification of the server-rendered HTML structure. It defines the language of the application as English and includes essential elements such as head, body, application content, and Next.js scripts.

### **Home: `index.tsx`**
Defines the Home component in a Next.js application. It displays a home feed of posts, either from the communities the user is a member of or generic posts if the user is not logged in or not a member of any communities.

**Description**

The `Home` component imports necessary components, hooks, and libraries. It starts by defining the Home function component, which has a series of states, hooks, and functions to load and display posts.

The `buildUserHomeFeed` function fetches the posts from the communities the user is a member of and updates the component's state. If the user is not a member of any communities, it calls the `buildGenericHomeFeed` function, which fetches generic posts and updates the component's state.

The `getUserPostVotes` function retrieves the votes for the posts displayed in the home feed and updates the component's state.

The component utilizes multiple `useEffect` hooks to manage loading posts and votes based on different conditions:

1. Load the home feed for authenticated users when the community snippets have been fetched.
2. Load the home feed for unauthenticated users when there is no user and the system is no longer attempting to fetch a user.
3. Fetch votes for the displayed posts after they are loaded and the user is logged in.

The component renders a `PageContent` component, containing a `CreatePostLink`, a `Stack` for displaying posts, a `Recommendations` component, and a `PersonalHome` component. It conditionally renders a `PostLoader` if it is loading posts or a `Stack` of `PostItem` components for each post.

**Purpose**

The purpose of this code is to define the Home component of a Next.js application, which fetches and displays a home feed of posts based on the user's community memberships or generic posts for unauthenticated users or users with no community memberships. It also provides additional features like creating a post, displaying post recommendations, and showing the user's personal home.

### **Page Not Found: `404.tsx`**
Defines the PageNotFound component in a Next.js application, which is displayed when a user tries to navigate to a non-existent page (404 error).

**Description**

The `PageNotFound` component is a functional React component that returns a JSX structure. It uses Chakra UI components to create a responsive layout. The component contains a `Flex` container with a centered message informing the user that the requested page does not exist, and a `Stack` containing two buttons for navigating back to the Home page and the All Communities page.

The `Flex` container has its direction set to "column," justifyContent and alignItems set to "center," and a minHeight of "60vh" to ensure the content is centered vertically within the viewport.

The message is displayed using a `Text` component with fontSize set to "2xl," fontWeight set to "bold," and color set to "gray.600."

The `Stack` component has its direction set to "row" and spacing set to "4," and it contains two `Link` components, each wrapping a `Button` component. These buttons allow users to navigate back to the Home page and the All Communities page.

**Purpose**

The purpose of this code is to define a user-friendly PageNotFound component for a Next.js application, which is displayed when a user navigates to a non-existent page (404 error). The component provides helpful navigation options for the user to return to the main sections of the application.

### **Communities: `communities.tsx`**
Defines the Communities component in a Next.js application, which is responsible for displaying the top 5 communities along with a "View More" button to load more communities.

**Description**

The `Communities` component is a functional React component that returns a JSX structure. It uses Chakra UI components to create a responsive layout. The component imports various hooks, functions, and components to fetch and display community data.

The `getCommunities` function is an asynchronous function that fetches the top 5 communities with the most members, plus an optional number of additional communities specified by the `numberOfExtraPosts` parameter. It utilizes the Firebase Firestore to query and fetch the communities data. The fetched data is then set in the `communities` state.

An effect hook (`useEffect`) is used to call the `getCommunities` function initially with a parameter of 0 to fetch the top 5 communities.

In the JSX structure, a `PageContent` component is used to wrap the main content. Inside, a `Stack` component is used to display the communities as `CommunityItem` components. If the data is still loading, the `CommunityLoader` component is displayed instead.

A "View More" button is placed below the communities list. When clicked, it calls the `getCommunities` function with a parameter of 5 to fetch additional communities.

On the right side of the page, a `Stack` component is used to display the `PersonalHome` component.

**Purpose**

The purpose of this code is to define the Communities component for the Next.js application, which displays the top 5 communities along with a "View More" button to load more communities. This component allows users to browse and join various communities available on the platform.

## **`/community`**
### **Community: `index.tsx`**
Defines a Redirect component in a Next.js application, which is responsible for redirecting users from the `/community` route to the root route (`/`).

**Description**

The Redirect component is a functional React component that doesn't return any JSX structure. Instead, it utilizes the `useRouter` hook from Next.js to access the `router` object.

An effect hook (`useEffect`) is used to call the `router.push("/")` method when the component is mounted, which navigates the user to the root route (`/`). The effect hook has `router` listed as its dependency to ensure that the effect only runs once when the `router` object is available.

**Purpose**

The purpose of this code is to define a Redirect component that navigates users from the `/community` route to the root route (`/`). This component can be used as a placeholder when a specific community page or route is not available or when the application needs to enforce navigation rules.

## **`/community/[communityId]`**
### **Community Page: `index.tsx`**
Defines a `CommunityPage` component for a Next.js application that displays the community page with the community's posts and information. It uses server-side rendering (SSR) to fetch the community data from Firebase Firestore and pass it as a prop to the client-side.

**Description**
1. `CommunityPageProps` is a TypeScript type that represents the props of the `CommunityPage` component. It has a single property, `communityData`, which is of type `Community`.

2. `CommunityPage` is a functional React component that receives `communityData` as a prop. It sets the received `communityData` to the `communityState` Recoil state using `useSetRecoilState`. If the `communityData` is not available or empty, it returns a `NotFound` component. Otherwise, it returns a JSX structure containing the `Header`, `PageContent`, `CreatePostLink`, `Posts`, and `About` components.

3. `getServerSideProps` is an async function that fetches the community data for the current community from Firebase Firestore using the `communityId` from the context query. It returns the community data as a prop to the client-side. If the community document doesn't exist or an error occurs, it returns an empty object as props.

**Purpose**
The purpose of this code is to define a `CommunityPage` component that displays the community page with the community's posts and information. It fetches the community data server-side and passes it to the client-side as a prop.

### **Post Submission: `submit.tsx`**
Defines a `SubmitPostPage` component for a Next.js application that displays the post submission page where users can create a new post. If a user is not logged in, they will be prompted to log in. The component includes a post creation form and a community information card.

**Description**

1. `SubmitPostPage` is a functional React component. It uses the `useAuthState` hook to get the current user's authentication state from Firebase, and the `useCommunityData` hook to get the community state value. It also uses the `useSetRecoilState` hook to get the setter function for the `authModalState` Recoil state.

2. Inside the `PageContent` component, the `SubmitPostPage` component first displays a "Create Post" heading.

3. If a user is logged in, the `NewPostForm` component is rendered with the `user`, `communityImageURL`, and `currentCommunity` props. If a user is not logged in, a message prompting the user to log in or sign up is displayed, along with `AuthButtons` for logging in or signing up.

4. Finally, if the `currentCommunity` data is available, the `About` component is rendered with the `communityData` prop.

**Purpose**

The purpose of this code is to define a `SubmitPostPage` component that displays the post submission page where users can create a new post. The component renders a post creation form if the user is logged in, or prompts the user to log in or sign up if they are not authenticated. The component also displays a community information card.

## **`/community/[communityId]/comments`**
### **Post: `[pid].tsx`**
Defines a `PostPage` component for a Next.js application that displays a single post, including the `PostItem`, `About`, and `Comments` components. The component fetches the necessary post data if it is not available in the state when the user navigates to the page directly using a link.

**Description**

1. `PostPage` is a functional React component. It uses several hooks, including `usePosts`, `useCommunityData`, `useAuthState`, and `useRouter`. It also uses the `useCustomToast` hook for displaying toast messages.

2. The component defines a `fetchPost` function to fetch a post by its ID from Firebase and update the state accordingly. The function sets the `postExists` state to `true` if the post is found, and `false` otherwise. It also updates the `hasFetched` and `postLoading` states.

3. A `useEffect` hook is used to fetch post data when the page is loaded or when the post ID changes. It checks if the post data is available in the state and fetches the data if necessary. If the post data is not valid, it redirects to the '404' NotFound page.

4. Inside the `PageContent` component, the `PostPage` component first checks if the post is loading. If it is, a `PostLoader` component is rendered. Otherwise, the `PostItem` and `Comments` components are rendered, along with the `About` component if the `currentCommunity` data is available.

**Purpose**

The purpose of this code is to define a `PostPage` component that displays a single post along with its related components. The component fetches the necessary post data if it is not available in the state and renders the `PostItem`, `About`, and `Comments` components accordingly.
