This directory contains the Chakra UI configuration for the entire application. It is responsible for defining global styles and customizations for UI components.

By customizing the Chakra UI theme and components, the application's appearance remains consistent and tailored to the specific requirements of the project. The configuration files in this directory enable easy management of global styles and component customizations.

# **Main Components**
## **Theme**
The custom theme is created by extending the default Chakra UI theme. It includes modifications to colors, fonts, and global styles. The theme is defined in the `theme.ts` file and is used to ensure a consistent appearance across the application.

## **Button Component**
The `Button` component is customized with different sizes and visual variants such as `solid`, `outline`, `oauth`, and `action`. The `button.ts` file contains the base styles, sizes, and variants for the button component, which are used throughout the application.

## **Other Components**
Additional components defined by Chakra UI can also be customised. Refer to the Chakra UI documentation by visiting [Customize Theme](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/customize-theme)
